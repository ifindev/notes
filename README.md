# Learning Notes

This is my own learning notes regarding:
- Software engineering 
- Cloud technologies including AWS and GCP
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Software architectures & principles
- Web-related technologies
- etc

After trying to use multiple note taking apps, I finally decided to just use markdown and store in in GitHub so that it will always be available anywhere and anytime.
