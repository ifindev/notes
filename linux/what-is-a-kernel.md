# What is a kernel?

Whenever I read or watch an explanation about Virtual Machines (VMs), Docker, and most importantly Linux, I heard a lot about "Kernel". I didn't know what a kernel is and didn't really care about it. But not today. 

So after digging around, I found out that kernel is basically a code that interfaces Software and Hardware. For example, we can use slider to adjust screen brightness in our laptops, smartphone, tablet, etc. To control the brightness emitted from the LCD screen, the software that responds to our gestures will communicate with a kernel that is responsible to handle communications between our gesture-responder software with the underlying LCD hardware. 

The simplest way to understand it that, kernel is a low-level software that bridges / abstracts away the communications between high-level software with the hardware on which the high-level softeware is running on.
